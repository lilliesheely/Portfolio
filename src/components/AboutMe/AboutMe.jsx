            <p>I am a Software Engineer with a passion for understanding the customer and empathy for everyone. Before my transition to software engineering, I worked for several startups, in a variety of operational roles, from customer service, operations association, and solutions delivery. My previous experience taught me to handle high stress situations in a fast-paced environment. I hope to take my passion for the customer into the engineering realm.</p>
